# Rubric: is this reproduction package ready to post?

<!--
THIS IS THE PART YOU WRITE. The skill in SKILL.md executes whatever
checks you define here. It ships empty on purpose: the judgment is your
work.

A filled rubric must contain:

1. At least one row in the checks table. Each row needs all four
   columns:
   - Check: a short name (used in the output JSON).
   - Evidence: exactly what to look at, and where in the package. Name
     the part (the claim comment, the repro report's environment
     record, the artifacts read against the issue's description, the
     repo-facts block) or a location from your
     references/evidence-guide.md. "The report" is not a source; "the
     output excerpt read against the error the issue describes" is.
   - Pass condition: a decision rule about the OUTCOME that someone
     else could apply and get your answer. Judge the thing itself (does
     the artifact show the issue's behavior?), never the write-up's
     shape (how many steps it has, how long it is, whether it uses a
     template's headings). Structure-shaped checks are what make
     graders disagree with themselves.
   - Weight: `required` (a fail here holds the package) or `preferred`
     (never changes the verdict).

2. A verdict rule below the table: how the check grades combine into
   accept (ready) or reject (hold), including how `unclear` is
   treated. The verdict space is binary. If you write no rule for
   `unclear`, the skill treats it as fail.

Cover what actually gets bad packages posted. The lecture named the
proof families: the environment is recorded, the steps are complete
and followable, the behavior shown matches the issue (not an adjacent
one), the outcome is stated honestly (an evidenced cannot-reproduce is
a pass, a confident wrong-target is not), and the words respect the
repo's conventions. A rubric that ignores a family will fail eval
packages designed around that family.

## Checks

| Check | Evidence | Pass condition | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
|names-the-issue|quotes the error message from the issue body|describes the issue and behavior and work required| required|
|environment-detail |Candidate repro report repo version and OS| names the version and OS the repo's bug template asks for, and matches the issue's version or says why it doesn't| required |
|steps-rerunnable| Candidate repro report reproduction or preparation steps | describes what the person did to prepare with specific steps to reproduce or make it rerunnable | required |
|Analysis-claim  | Candidate repro report findings of analysis | Provides description of what the author found when reproducing the issue it might describe next steps | preferred |
|expected-behaviour| Candidate repro report expected outcome | mentions what is expected during reproduction | preferred |
|actual-behaviour| actual outcome | honestly tells what actually happen during reproduction | required |
|communication|issue comments|Communication respects repo, comments are issue-specific, honest about completed work, and follow applicable repo rules |preferred|

## Verdict rule

<!-- State how the grades above combine into accept or reject, and how
unclear is treated. Example shape (write your own): "accept if every
required check passes; preferred checks never change the verdict;
unclear counts as fail." -->

Accept if every required check passes; preferred checks never change the verdict, they rank accepted issues; unclear counts as fail.
